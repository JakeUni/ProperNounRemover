# ProperNounRemover

This was a challange for a coursework completed as part of my university course.
The software will detect, find and erase proper nouns in a given text.


This will read from a text file and remove any proper nouns, writing the result into a new file.
The program will detect proper nouns and does not use a dictionary of known propernouns.
When a proper noun is detected the software will attribute a score to it each time the word is found
based on whether the word was a proper noun or not when found, this is done to prevent false positives.
